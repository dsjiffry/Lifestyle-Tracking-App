Main Objective
    *Build an app that will identify a user’s daily routine, daily fitness, and food consumption to create a personal fitness schedule.
    Then by monitoring the user’s expression and using obtained information, difficulty level of the app will be changed.
    
Main Research Question
    *Fitness is a major concern in modern society due to technological advancements making life easy. So, people use fitness apps to try and keep track of their health and to make
    their lives healthier. But a lot of fitness apps are static and do only recommend actions, they do not change with the user. Also, there is no single app that gives a fitness
    plan, daily routines, nutrition plan and monitors the user’s expression. Our studies show that most people prepare meals at home, less than twice per day.But most nutrition
    apps only suggest home-cooked meals and do not show healthy dine-out options, this makes it less practical for most people. Studies also show that even though
    health is a serious thing, when making apps they should be fun otherwise it’s hard for users to develop a habit.Another study shows that with a large number of students
    using social media there is an opportunity to make a fitness app that can leverage this. Since studies have shown that students who used social media more were less likely to
    describe their daily routines as “dreary”.More research on changing behavior has found that interventions are more likely to be effective if they include features such as
    goal-setting, rapid intention formation, performance, self-monitoring, individually tailored feedback, goal-reviewing, and progression.Also sharing app information on
    social media can result in friendly competition and camaraderie among strangers that may facilitate behavior change and improve well-being.

    *Evaluating the facial expression at the highest point of accuracy is difficult.While there are methods for extracting emotional expression, there are not enough studies on the android system.
    The goal of this research component is to find a way to efficiently extract emotions and communicate with the android.
    
    For a facial expression a image or video frame may be used as inputs.Train a particular model when it comes to video frames; compared to the image train model, it needs lots of video frames.
    It is very difficult to find the correct data set, since irrelevant data sets are among the correct data sets.
    
    It's difficult to find proper neural networks. There's too much use of techniques and neural networks to capture facial expression. The required neural network must be less time to train, predict,
    and perform with the highest accuracy. The Proposed facial extraction system helps to adjust the difficulty of mobile games according to the user's emotions. The emotion extraction part that can send
    extracted emotion using a neural network while the user plays the game; it does not interrupt the player 's experience.
    
    The author acquires a proper collection of data and an effective neural network, which is the proposed device capable of overcoming this situation.

    *There are many diet apps in play store and app store. All those apps are giving diet plans in commonly. They are changing the diet plans without getting data and an without doing any analyzation.
    All those are just pre-defined according to the weeks. They just changing their diet plans after few weeks run. 
    But there some apps(mainly used by hospitals) which take some details of user and doing some small analysis. But them are only specific for certain categories ( Ex :  Only for Diabetic Patients).  
    And mainly these any kind of diet plan apps are unable to track the user and changing according to user’s behavior and unable to change the amount of nutrition daily. 
    And there is no any app which can do all these functions and available for general people without any categorization. So anyone which wants to be healthy and maintain good physical condition, can use this app

    *research problem is how do we build an app that would help a person become healthier? Without having the user drastically change their current lifestyle at once. The issue with the currently available apps is that
    they require the user to suddenly make major changes to their life. While people who are deeply concerned about their health will accept this, most average people only worry about their health in a more general sense.
    They are not willing to suddenly change their life, it is human nature to be comfortable with a certain pattern and an app suggesting sudden changes might be perceived as annoying. So, I decided my section would initially
    monitor how their current life pattern and then using that data make inferences about how it could be improved. Then over a long period of time, we suggest changes and slowly incorporate them into the user’s lifestyle. This way
    the user will be more receptive to our changes and there is less chance of them abandoning the app. Based on the feedback we get from the user’s activities; our app could adapt and learn. This will allow me to become better
    at suggesting healthier activities for a user and to assist the other sections of our app. I believe that this combination of initially learning a user’s lifestyle and then deriving changes that could be made to make it healthier
    is a unique approach. While there has been researching done into identifying a user’s lifestyle, none of them seem to have attempted to improve it, especially in the mobile app space

    * research problem is how to give an application solution that should have best fitness features such as personal account, setting goals, actual activity tracking, and social elements without any change to their day to day activities.
    With the busy life style, the user must change their life style if they use currently available fitness application. Most of the users do not like to change their life style and day to day activities while some will do it who concern
    their health mostly. So I am deciding to monitor the physical features of the user like Age, weight, height, steps doing in the whole day and the heart rate of the user in very first level of my section. Initially refer to those physical
    features of the user and generate the fitness workout for the user. So there is no any effect for the day to day life pattern of the user. Our application will generate the Balanced diet and the daily routine to the user. So after the application
    generate balanced diet and the daily routine for the user the system will track those details also to generate fitness workout for the user. This will allow me to generate good fitness workout series for the user to stay healthy and active. I believe
    this combination of initially referring to the physical features and make changes later with the balanced diet and the daily routine will be a unique approach. While there has been research to generate fitness workout with physical features such as Age,
    Weight, Height and Age, None of them seem to improve it.
